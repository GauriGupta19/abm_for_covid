# First 100 days of pandemic; an interplay of pharmaceutical, behavioral and digital interventions â€“ A study using agent based modeling

## Interventions Supported

- Clinical: Two-dose Vaccination (delay days, efficacy), Testing (specificity, speed)
- Digital: Contact Tracing (adoption rate, compliance probability)
- Behavioral - Quarantine (days, break probability)

## Implementation Reference
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04421.pdf

## Performance benchmarking
- 100,000 agents and 2 million interactions per second (to include graphic!)
